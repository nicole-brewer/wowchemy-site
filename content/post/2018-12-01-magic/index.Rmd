In the fall of my senior year, I serendipitously came across a one credit hour class where undergraduate students like myself went to local middle and high schools to mentor young women in in after-school coding clubs. I didn't really need the credit hour, but I've always enjoyed working with kids and promoting the representation of women in STEM, so I signed up for Mentors for Aspiring Girls in Computing (MAGIC) right away.

The instructor, my now friend Phil Sands, took a very hands-off approach and let us do the lesson and activity planning. As I've learned time and again, teaching engagingly is not easy; it's a skill improved by practice. It was often difficult to cator to a range of skill levels, and getting any sort of visual or verbal feedback often seemed impossible, which meant it was hard to talk with the kids instead of at them.

As challenging as it was to get through to the young women, it was equally rewarding. I got to share my unique experiences using computing to enable math and science, and even if they didn't appreciate what that mean at the time, a few might be more informed of their choices of the future. Certainly, if I had been told what bioinformatics was when I was their age, I would have been well equipped to turn my junior year biology major into a career that wasn't medical school, instead of taking three extra years to figure that out for myself.

Perhaps the simplest and most impactful part of the program is that we got to influence the girls' perceptions on what a software engineers look like, and created an environment where they didn't feel a sense of exclusion based on normative stereotypes. I'm proud to have been a part of it.
