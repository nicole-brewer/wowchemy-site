You are a manager, and you're writing an ad for a research software position. You want to write an ad that is inclusive of underrepresented individuals. What do you do?

Looking for inspiration? Visit [RSE Roles](https://us-rse.org/rse-roles/) to find real RSE job descriptions. Search for the "inclusive" tag to find examples of job adverts that were written with underrepresented groups in mind.

[The National Center for Women & Information Technology](https://ncwit.org/) is here to help you write better postings. In the pamflet [Tips for Writing Better Job Ads](https://ncwit.org/resource/jobdescriptionanalysis/) provide "before and after" examples that might help you identify and remove biases in your current draft. They even provide [a checklist](https://ncwit.org/resource/jobdescriptionchecklist/) to help you analyze what you have, step by step.

[Gender Decoder](https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) is an online tool that will scan text for gender-coded language from job ads to help you organization remove biases and subtle queues that dissuade women from applying. It is the subsequence of a research paper called [Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality](https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/static/documents/Gaucher-Friesen-Kay-JPSP-Gendered-Wording-in-Job-ads.pdf).

Finally, if you'd like to take a deeper dive into this subject, consider purchasing the book [The Better Allies Approach to Hiring](https://betterallies.com/).
