abstract: On October 14, 2021 the established national/multinational RSE Associations (e.g., UK, Germany, Netherlands, Nordics, AUS/NZ, etc.) are coordinating simultaneous locally-hosted RSE Events in the first ever “International RSE Day.” The international coordination is intended to raise the profile of each event, and simultaneously, RSEs around the world. We plan to participate by hosting a US-RSE event that day.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Join us for a panel discussion to introduce teams of researchers, RSEs, and CI professionals and learn about their experiences in the research computing community.
