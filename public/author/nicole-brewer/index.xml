&lt;p&gt;In the fall of my senior year, I serendipitously came across a one credit hour class where undergraduate students like myself went to local middle and high schools to mentor young women in in after-school coding clubs. I didn’t really need the credit hour, but I’ve always enjoyed working with kids and promoting the representation of women in STEM, so I signed up for Mentors for Aspiring Girls in Computing (MAGIC) right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor, my now friend Phil Sands, took a very hands-off approach and let us do the lesson and activity planning. As I’ve learned time and again, teaching engagingly is not easy; it’s a skill improved by practice. It was often difficult to cator to a range of skill levels, and getting any sort of visual or verbal feedback often seemed impossible, which meant it was hard to talk with the kids instead of at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; tweet 1070824487426449413 &amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As challenging as it was to get through to the young women, it was equally rewarding. I got to share my unique experiences using computing to enable math and science, and even if they didn’t appreciate what that mean at the time, a few might be more informed of their choices of the future. Certainly, if I had been told what bioinformatics was when I was their age, I would have been well equipped to turn my junior year biology major into a career that wasn’t medical school, instead of taking three extra years to figure that out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=“teaching.jpg” title=“Teaching the math of JS animation” lightbox=“true” &amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the simplest and most impactful part of the program is that we got to influence the girls’ perceptions on what a software engineers look like, and created an environment where they didn’t feel a sense of exclusion based on normative stereotypes. I’m proud to have been a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
