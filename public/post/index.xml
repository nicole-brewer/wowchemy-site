&lt;p&gt;Women in HPC at Purdue is proud to present the Long Tales of Science Podcast, where we interview women in science, engineering, social science, and the humanities who use supercomputers to empower their research. Today I want to take about the origin story of the the podcast’s namesake. The term long tail has it’s origin in business, where it it used to illustrate how a few high cost products can create as much or more profit than all the top top-sellers combined. Even though there is a low probability of purchase, the developing these products pay out. Over time, this term has been adopted by the advanced computing community. In this context, the long tail of science represents research projects enabled by HPC resources, science gateways, software, and expert support. We live in the data-age, but data on it’s own doesn’t provide us directly with knowledge. It takes transformation, analysis, visualization, machine learning, simulation, and modeling to transform data into scientific insight. As data get bigger or more fine-grained, so does the need for computational resources in small laboratories without their own advanced cyberinfrastructure. These small labs occupy the long tail, and if we can invest in providing them with HPC resources, there’s no telling how high the payout will be. One goal of this podcast is to share the success stories of computing enabled research. The other is to raise the visibility of women in the field. Women are highly under-represented in HPC and we want to make role models in the field more conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentors for Aspiring Girls in Computing</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of my senior year, I serendipitously came across a one credit hour class where undergraduate students like myself went to local middle and high schools to mentor young women in in after-school coding clubs. I didn’t really need the credit hour, but I’ve always enjoyed working with kids and promoting the representation of women in STEM, so I signed up for Mentors for Aspiring Girls in Computing (MAGIC) right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor, my now friend Phil Sands, took a very hands-off approach and let us do the lesson and activity planning. As I’ve learned time and again, teaching engagingly is not easy; it’s a skill improved by practice. It was often difficult to cator to a range of skill levels, and getting any sort of visual or verbal feedback often seemed impossible, which meant it was hard to talk with the kids instead of at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; tweet 1070824487426449413 &amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As challenging as it was to get through to the young women, it was equally rewarding. I got to share my unique experiences using computing to enable math and science, and even if they didn’t appreciate what that mean at the time, a few might be more informed of their choices of the future. Certainly, if I had been told what bioinformatics was when I was their age, I would have been well equipped to turn my junior year biology major into a career that wasn’t medical school, instead of taking three extra years to figure that out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=“teaching.jpg” title=“Teaching the math of JS animation” lightbox=“true” &amp;gt;}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the simplest and most impactful part of the program is that we got to influence the girls’ perceptions on what a software engineers look like, and created an environment where they didn’t feel a sense of exclusion based on normative stereotypes. I’m proud to have been a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;who-is-women-in-hpc&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Who is Women in HPC?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-you-identify-as-a-woman-in-hpc&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you identify as a Woman in HPC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are young, you think that non-linear career paths are the exception, not the rule. Certainly when I was getting close to graduation, I felt stressed that I didn’t have a clear career path in mind that was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey into HPC has always been rooted in an interest for science. In undergrad, I bounced around majors for many years, always fascinated by psychology, biology, physics, and chemistry, but not seeing a career path in them that appealed to me. At the time, I hadn’t had a positive research experience, and I didn’t want one because it seemed to me that research would just be just like my lab classes: following rote science experiment recipes in flourescent lighting in a dank, windowless basement. Then I thought I would try engineering, because engineers studied science too, but they got to be creative and their diploma translated into a well-paying job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I happened into my first programming course for engineers completely by accident. After years of transience, I immediately got the sense that I was supposed to be a software engineer. While all the other future scientist and engineers in the class were bemoaning missing semicolons, I was entranced by how powerful it was to have the computer excute the recipe for you. And you could even chose to program in a room with a large window. So I switched into math and computer science and still feel so fortunate that I found my true calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experience with HPC was when I did my first mathematics research project. Basically I was running a program that was unpredictibly computation-heavy to create data points in a large set. The fun part for me was using the Purdue cluster, Halstead, to parallelize these runs. The problem was trivial, but learning how to utilize a supercomputer with a batch system was exciting. It was then that I started attending WHPC meetings, and learning about all the research enabled by HPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After concluding my research, I got my first software engineering internship in industry. I learned a lot of valuale lessons about legacy software, the importance of testing in production, and how much I disliked Windows, but I just wasn’t experiencing the magic of discovery that I had in research. At the same time I continued to attend WHPC meetings. In one of these meetings, we went around the room and each shared how our research and how it was related to HPC. Afterward, Carol and our former co-founder, Gladys came up to me and encouraged me to submit a poster to the Research Computing conference PEARC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing this was a big breakthrough for me, because I realized I could use software engineering to enable the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was there that I was encouraged to submit my research to the research computing conference, PEARC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-does-your-professional-role-in-hpc-look-like&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does your professional role in HPC look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the software I work on is directly related to supporting research. Sometime the software is related to HPC and sometimes it isn’t, but at the very least when I’m working with researchers, I know when to point them towards an HPC resource and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see HPC as the forfront of this intersection
o How did your career path lead you to HPC?
2. What does your professional role look like on a daily basis? (talk about grants, day job, partnerships &amp;amp; interactions, research, history….)
o Why do you like working in the HPC/research computing space.
o What limitations do you encounter?
o What challenges have you have you faced along the way?
3. Audience Questions OR What are your hopes for this Chapter of Women in HPC?
4. Audience Questions OR Best career advice you’ve ever heard?&lt;/p&gt;
